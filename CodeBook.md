##Course Project Inputs
The following is a brief description of the Course Project input components: 

* The original source data set is split into a ‘training’ data set, a ‘test’ data set, and a data set that is common to both the training and test data sets.  
* The training data set and test data set each consist of 3 data tables.  
* The X_training.txt data table contains 7,352 observations of 561 accelerometer/gyroscope measurements organized into rows and columns respectively. 
* The y_training.txt data table contains 7,352 observations of the type of Activity taking place during each observation window.  Note that these 7,352 observations are in the same order as the observations in the X_training.txt data table and the subject_training.txt data table. 
* The subject_training.txt data table contains 7,352 observations identifying the Subject being measured.
* The X_test.txt data table contains 2,947 observations of 561 accelerometer/gyroscope measurements organized into rows and columns respectively. 
* The y_test.txt data table contains 2,947 observations of the type of Activity taking place during each observation window.  Note that these 2,947 observations are in the same order as the observations in the X_test.txt data table and the subject_test.txt data table. 
* The subject_test.txt data table contains 2,947 observations identifying the Subject being measured.
* There are two data tables common to training and test: 
* The activity_labels.txt data table maps the Activity ‘ID’ to the corresponding Activity ‘Name’. 
* The features.txt data table maps the Feature variable ‘ID’ to the corresponding Feature variable ‘Name’. 

##Work Performed to ‘Tidy’ Up the Data
* The generic column names in the training and test ‘measurement’ data tables were replaced with the Feature variable ‘Name’ from the features.txt data table. . 
* Removed Feature variables that were not a ‘mean’ or ‘standard deviation’ measurement.  
* The corresponding Subject and Activity information was added to the training and test ‘measurement’ data tables.
* The 7,352 training observations were merged with the 2,947 test observations to produce a single data table containing 10,299 observations. 
* The ‘aggregate’ function was used to create a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject
* Further ‘tidy’ up the data table by moving the ‘Subject’ variable to the first column location. This increases readability.
